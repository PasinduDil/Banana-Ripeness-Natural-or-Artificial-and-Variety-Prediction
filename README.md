# 🍌 Banana Classification using VGG16

This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that classifies four types of bananas using a **pretrained VGG16** model. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of different banana types and achieves high accuracy through transfer learning.

## 📌 **Project Overview**
- **Objective**: Classify bananas into four categories:
  - `ambul_kesel_artificial`
  - `ambul_kesel_natural`
  - `Anamal_Natural`
  - `Anamalu_Artificial`
- **Model Used**: VGG16 (Pretrained on ImageNet)
- **Dataset**: Images of different banana types organized into separate folders.
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib.
- **Training**: Model is trained using data augmentation and optimized with Adam optimizer.
